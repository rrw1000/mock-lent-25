\begin{enumerate}
\item Give the transformations, in homogeneous coordinates, required
  to rotate a unit cube located with corners at $(a,b,c)$ $a,b,c \in
  0,1$ 45 degrees (in any axis) about its $(1,1,1)$ corner, sheer it
  with factor $0.5$ parallel to the y axis, and locate it with its
  center at the origin. \fullmarks{4}

\item Why are mirrored surfaces difficult for a conventional polygon
  rasterisation renderer to cope with?  How might you use texture
  mapping to (approximately) render them and why might curved mirrored
  surfaces pose a problem? \fullmarks{6}

\item Describe the colour rendering pipeline. \fullmarks{8}

\item What is regular grid supersampling? Why is it problematic and
  what is your preferred alternative (and why)?  \fullmarks{2}
