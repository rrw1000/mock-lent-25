  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    A programmer is writing a program that computes various statistics
    from a binary tree of objects in Java. The tree is generated by code
    to be written by another team to which the programmer will give a
    programming interface.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Define entities in Java suitable to provide the team who are generating these objects. These entities should be as type-safe as possible. \fullmarks{4}
  \item Show how your entities could be adapted to implement the strategy pattern for computing statistics. \fullmarks{4}
  \item Show how your entities could be adapted to implement the visitor pattern. \fullmarks{4}
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item
  If you had no lambda expressions in Java, how could you preprocess your code to implement them? \fullmarks{2}

\item Give an example of the use of contravariance in a Java program \fullmarks{2}
\item State two principles that should be observed when constructing an inheritance heirarchy \fullmarks{2}
\item What's the difference between \verb|Set<T extends Number>| and \\
  \verb|Set<? extends Number>| ? \fullmarks{2}
