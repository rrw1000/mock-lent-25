  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Design a branch predictor for a single-issue RISC-V processor
    with a 5-stage pipeline, a 32KiB direct-mapped instruction cache
    and a 128-entry software-filled TLB.  Comment on your design
    parameters and algorithm. Estimate how effective your branch
    predictor might be and outline what you inferred about the
    transistor budget for this processor; what would you do if the
    transistor budget was quite large?.  \fullmarks{6}

  \item Outline how host memory access is arranged on a GPU, and design a simple
    coprocessor for handling it. How might the coprocessor interact with both the
    host driver and other GPU subsystems in order to improve latency?
    \fullmarks{8}

  \item Outline inclusive, exclusive and non-inclusive, non-exclusive cache eviction strategies.
     When is each useful in a multicore, heirarchical-cache system (and why)?
     \fullmarks{4}

   \item It is proposed to rename registers on input to the CPU in part (a) in order to provide for a
     larger register file on the chip; how might you do this? Do you think it is a good idea?
